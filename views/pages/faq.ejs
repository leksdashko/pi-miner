												<div class="accordion-body">
													<p>Pi is a new cryptocurrency for and by everyday people that you can “mine” (or earn) from your phone.</p>
													<p>Cryptocurrencies are new form of digital money that are maintained and secured by a community, instead of by governments or banks. Today, you can mine (or earn) Pi by helping to secure the currency and by growing Pi’s trusted network. While most cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) have been very hard for everyday people to use and access, Pi puts the power of cryptocurrency into the palm of your hand.</p>

										<div id="collapse3" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
											<div class="accordion-body">
												<p>Pi is not a scam. It is a genuine effort by a team of Stanford graduates to give everyday people greater access to cryptocurrency.</p>

												<p>Pi's core team is led by two Stanford PhDs and one Stanford MBA, all of whom helped build Stanford's blockchain community. We cannot guarantee that the project will succeed. However, we do promise to work our hardest to make our shared dreams a reality, while maintaining the highest standards of integrity. You can learn more about us in “Core Team” page in the main menu of the app.</p>

									<div id="collapse4" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
										<div class="accordion-body">
											<p>This app allows you to earn Pi coins by making simple contributions to Pi's community. The more you contribute, the more Pi you earn.</p>

											<p>To start earning Pi, check in every 24 hours and hit the lightning button to start mining. Once you are mining, you can boost your hourly rate by inviting trusted friends and family to join the community. After 3 days of mining, you can boost your earnings more by building your security circle, which contributes to the overall security of the network. Keep in mind, earlier members of the network mine at a higher rate than those that come after them.</p>

									<div id="collapse5" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
										<div class="accordion-body">
											<p>You do not need to leave the app open to mine. Pi does not affect your phone's performance, drain your battery, or use your network data. Once you hit the lightning button, you can even close the app and you will continue to mine Pi.</p>

											<p>So how can you mine a cryptocurrency without draining your battery or data? Instead of burning energy as proof of work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin do, Pi secures its ledger when members vouch for each other as trustworthy. This forms a network of interlocking “security circles” that determines who can execute transactions. This novel approach allows crypto mining on your phone by leveraging your existing social connections, with no financial cost, no battery drain and a light footprint on the planet. Read the technical section in our White paper for more accurate and detailed explanation.</p>

								<button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse6" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo">Why do earlier members mine at a higher rate?</button>
								<div id="collapse6" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
									<div class="accordion-body">
										<p>Earlier members mine at a higher rate to reward contributions to the network when they are most needed.</p>

										<p>Pi aims to be the world's most widely used and distributed cryptocurrency. To achieve that goal, Pi incentivizes its earliest members to make contributions that will ensure its success (e.g., securing and growing the network). To reflect the importance of early contributions, the rate of mining decreases as more people join the network. At this time, the base rate of mining halves every time the number of active users increases by a factor of 10 (see graph below). This rate will eventually fall to 0 when the network reaches a certain number of users (e.g. 10 million or 100 million). At that point, just like Bitcoin, miners will continue to be rewarded through transaction fees and not through the minting of new currency.</p>

							<div id="collapse7" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
								<div class="accordion-body">
									<p>As an Ambassador, you earn up to a 25% bonus on your base mining rate for each person you invite to the network.</p>
									<p>You become an Ambassador when new members join your earning team by using your invitation code when they sign up for Pi Network. Each member of your earning team provides a 25% boost to your earnings when they are actively mining. A new member can only be added to their inviter's earning team, because each member only joins Pi once using one inviter’s invitation code. In other words, unlike the security circles where people can be added into multiple member’ circles based on trust, earning teams are fixed based on who invited whom. Each invitee in the world can only be claimed by one inviter.</p>
